# React Suspended

A React application riddled with security vulnerabilities so you can learn how not to write insecure code.

---

Modern frontend frameworks like React are well thought of in their application security design and that’s great. However, there is still plenty of room for developers to make mistakes and use insecure APIs, vulnerable components, or generally do the wrong thing that turns user input into a Cross-site Scripting vulnerability (XSS). Let me show you how React applications get hacked in the real world with React Suspended educational experience.

## Derivative work

This codebase makes use of derivative work created by [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com), in particular their open source website design # [Blk• Design  System React](https://demos.creative-tim.com/blk-design-system-react). I used their work because it provided me with a realistic and functional React application, completely designed too, which allowed me to speed up my work on the security aspects.
